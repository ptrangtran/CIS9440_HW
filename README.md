## Nutrition, Physical Activity, and Obesity - Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) Dataset

# Overview 
This dataset contains comprehensive information on adult diet, physical activity, and weight status collected through the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS). BRFSS is a state-based system of health surveys established by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the United States. The data collected from BRFSS serves as a crucial resource for understanding and addressing public health issues related to obesity, nutrition, physical activity, and breastfeeding.

# Content
The dataset includes a wide range of variables related to:
- Dietary habits: Information on food consumption patterns, dietary preferences, and intake of specific food groups
- Physical activity: Data on the frequency, duration, and intensity of physical activities undertaken by adults
- Weight status: Measurements of height and weight, enabling the calculation of Body Mass Index (BMI) and assessment of obesity prevalence
- Other relevant factors: Demographic information, socioeconomic status, and health-related behaviors

# Data Source
The data is sourced from the DNPAO's Data, Trends, and Maps database, maintained by the Division of Nutrition, Physical Activity, and Obesity (DNPAO) at the CDC.

# Data Model
First step was to understand the dataset with the help of the data dictionary. For dimensional modeling, the data dictionary serves as a guide for identifying potential fact tables, dimension tables, and their respective attributes.

The next step was to create logical and physical model with DBSchema and store the data into a storage.
